<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Basab (She/her)</h1>


- ðŸ”­ I am working on my master's thesis at the Technical University of Munich. In my thesis, I focus on using deep learning to denoise magnetic resonance spectra.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning about diffusion models. In particular, I am studying about Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and am interested in applying conditional DDPM to denoise spectroscopic data. This is a challenging task, but I am eager to see the results and understand the potential of DDPM in solving this problem.
- Using the knowledge from my thesis, I am currently working with @marc-gav to prepare a PR to include the implementation of [Image Super-Resolution via Iterative Refinement](https://iterative-refinement.github.io) in the [HuggingFace diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) research repository.
