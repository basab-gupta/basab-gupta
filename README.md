<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Basab (She/her)</h1>


- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on my master's thesis at the Technical University of Munich. In my thesis, I focus on using deep learning to denoise magnetic resonance spectra.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about about diffusion models. In particular, I am studying about Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and am interested in applying DDPM to denoise spectroscopic data. This is a challenging task, but I am eager to see the results and understand the potential of DDPM in solving this problem.
- Using the knowledge from my thesis, I am currently working on implementing the Image Super-Resolution via Iterative Refinement paper in the HuggingFace diffusers repository. This involves using Python, PyTorch, and the HuggingFace diffusers and accelerator library to implement and test the algorithms.
